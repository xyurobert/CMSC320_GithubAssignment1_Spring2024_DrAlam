Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because my interests within computer science
(machine learning and computational finance) are built on top of data. Taking 
CMSC320 would allow me to develop the necessary skills to effectively collect 
data and build models for these interests of mine.
